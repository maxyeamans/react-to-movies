This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React-to-Movies

This is an app I'm using to demonstrate React/general javascript stuff: React hooks, React lifecycle methods, async/await, and using map() to map over an array to create components.

### How to use this

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. In your terminal, cd to this repo and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Be utterly amazed at the ability to...search for movies.
